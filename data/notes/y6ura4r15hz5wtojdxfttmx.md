## Basis vectors

Linear independent vectors that span the whole vector space. All other vectors in same space can be interpreted as linear combinations of basis vectors

## Matrix
### Square Matrix

#### Determinant
Measure how area changes due to transformation, 0 means squished into lower-dimension, no inversion

#### Rank
Number of dimension in outputs (column space)

- Full rank: dimension of column space equals number of columns

-  Null space (kernel); space of all vectors land on zero vector (origin)

### Non-square Matrix
Transformation between dimensions
