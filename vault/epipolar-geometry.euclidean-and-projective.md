## Points at infinity (Idea points)
Points where parallel line meets

## Line at infinity
Line where all idea points lies upon

## Transformation in Euclidean Space

> **IMPORTANT** [[Points at infinity (Idea points)|epipolar-geometry.euclidean-and-projective#points-at-infinity-idea-points]] preserving, parallel lines remain parallel

### Rigid
angle, area preserving (translation, rotation, reflection)

### Similarity
angle preserving (translation, rotation, reflection, scaling)

### Affine
angle, area are not preserved (translation, rotation, reflection, scaling, skew)


## Projective Transformation
[[Points at infinity (Idea points)|epipolar-geometry.euclidean-and-projective#points-at-infinity-idea-points]] are not preserved, only straightness is preserved
