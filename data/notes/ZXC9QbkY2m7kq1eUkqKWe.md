Exposure w.r.t. ambient light

## Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
Approximation of Ambient Occlusion

> [From Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_space_ambient_occlusion):
For every pixel on the screen, the pixel shader samples the depth values around the current pixel and tries to compute the amount of occlusion from each of the sampled points. In its simplest implementation, the occlusion factor depends only on the depth difference between sampled point and current point.
