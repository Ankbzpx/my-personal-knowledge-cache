## Aliasing
Caused by sampling at insufficient rate. In computer graphics, it happens when representing a high-resolution image at a lower resolution.

## Anti-Aliasing
Methods to smooth out jagged edges.

## Full-Scene Anti-Aliasing (FSAA)
Sample multiple locations within pixel (supersampling), render and combine the results.

## Multisample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA)
Multisampling refers to a specific optimization of supersampling (a.k.a. not supersampling every pixel), usually only at edges of primitives.
