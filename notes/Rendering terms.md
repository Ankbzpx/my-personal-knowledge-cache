# Rendering terms

**Incident light**: Light falls on object surface

**Specular reflection**: Mirror like reflection

**Diffuse reflection**: The reflection of light from a surface such that a ray incident on the surface is scattered as many angles (contrast to specular reflection)

**Albedo**: 1. Physics: The proportion of incident light that is reflected away from a surface. 2. PBR: base color without shadows (Diffuse in non-PBR)
