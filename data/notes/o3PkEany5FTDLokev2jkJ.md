My personal knowledge cache using [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so)

## History
It was during my first job, at the start-up company called PixelShift.AI, that I acquired most prominent skill as a software engineer-the ability to read source code. It opened up a new way of learning and my knowledge expanded rapidly ever since. Learning new things is thriving but noting them down cogently and organized is hard. I often found myself forget the context few month later, making the notes completely intelligible. Additionally, some notes need frequent update as my previous understanding could be parochial, antiquated or even erroneous.

In desperate attempt to facilitate the noting/updating experience, I came across [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so) and found it surprisingly congenial to my personal need. With it, I have gradually grown the habit of caching, linking back and extending my knowledge base.

## Disclaimer
The notes are collections of information I found along the journey. I use backquote to denote sources, but I am likely to miss some references, so apology in advance. Also, they are my personal understandings, usually added when I first encounter the topic and will be updated only when I come across it again, so some of them could be incomplete or wrong.
