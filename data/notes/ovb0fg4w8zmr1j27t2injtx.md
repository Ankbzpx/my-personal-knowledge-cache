## Triangle
- Triangle contains 3 vertices ($v_0$, $v_1$, $v_2$) and 3 directed edges ($e_{01}$, $e_{12}$, $e_{20}$)
- Vertices are counter-clockwise ordered, define face normal with right hand rule

## Euler Characteristics
> Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic

$$
\chi = |V| - |E| + |F|
$$
where $|V|$ is number of vertices, $|E|$ is number of edges and $|F|$ is number of faces

For convex polyhedron's surface
$$
|V| - |E| + |F| = 2
$$

Euler Characteristics is toplological invariant (invariant under [[Homeomorphic|geometry.mesh-parameterization#homeomorphic]])

## TODO
- [ ] Toplological genus
