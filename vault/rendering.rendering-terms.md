## Incident light
Light falls on object surface

## Specular reflection
Mirror like reflection

## Diffuse reflection
The reflection of light from a surface such that a ray incident on the surface is scattered as many angles (contrast to specular reflection)

## Albedo
1. Physics: The proportion of incident light that is reflected away from a surface
2. PBR: base color without shadows (Diffuse in non-PBR)
